# ProteinOS

An interactive educational platform for learning about protein synthesis through immersive visualizations and engaging content.

[Live Demo](https://proteinos.vercel.app/)

## About the Project

ProteinOS is designed to make learning about protein synthesis intuitive and engaging. By visualizing complex molecular processes, we aim to help students and educators better understand the fundamental mechanisms of life.

The website covers:
- Transcription (DNA to mRNA)
- Translation (mRNA to protein)
- Protein Folding & Function
- Interactive 3D models of molecular structures

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore the protein synthesis process through dynamic 3D models
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Follow the journey from DNA to functional proteins
- **Knowledge Assessment**: Test your understanding with an interactive quiz
- **AI Chatbot Assistant**: Get answers to your protein synthesis questions
- **Educational Video Resources**: Curated collection of relevant educational videos

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Animations**: Framer Motion, AOS
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js
- **Chatbot**: Custom AI implementation
- **Deployment**: Vercel
